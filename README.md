## Description
The CPU Scheduling Simulator is a Python-based program designed to help you simulate and analyze CPU scheduling algorithms, including Round Robin, FCFS, and SJF.

To run the simulator and analyze your processes data, follow these steps:
1. Input processes data: Provide Arrival time and CPU/IO/CPU time for each process in the **"Processes.txt"** file.
2. Run the simulation: Execute <code>python Main.py</code> to simulate all three algorithms.
3. Output files: The simulator will generate separate output files for each algorithm: **"RoundRobin_Output.txt"**, **"FCFS_Output.txt"**, and **"SJF_Output.txt"**.
4. Process-specific statistics: These output files contain detailed statistics for each process, such as response time, turnaround time, and waiting time.
5. Overall statistics: Additionally, the simulator calculates overall statistics, including total time, CPU idle time, CPU burst time, CPU utilization, and throughput.
